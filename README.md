👤 Authorized Faces

This project supports face authentication.
For privacy reasons, no sample images are included in this repo.

To enable this feature:

Add your own images into the folder:

data/authorized_faces/<your_name>/


Each folder should contain multiple images of that person.

Jarvis will automatically detect and authorize based on those images.

---

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository does not include any personal or sensitive face data.
You must add your own authorized images for testing.
